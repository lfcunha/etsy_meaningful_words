Once picked, the hard shells are cracked open and the fruit pulp/powder is separated from the seeds and the shell.

The work is of very high quality; it&#39;s been beautifully &#39;up-cycled&#39; into a messenger or crossover bag. We believe that the Swiss Cross on the front of the bag might have been applied at the same time as the strap.\n\nAs can be seen in Photo 9, the ammo bag has a rather elegant closing system. A strong saddle leather thong slips over a metal loop and then secured by a second piece of leather threading through the same loop. \n\nThe handle, also made of saddle leather, has a metal bracket so that the when not in use, it can slide down flush to the bag. This bracket also holds the handle in place when the bag is in use, giving enough space for the user&#39;s hands.\n\nThe bag has five small metal feet to keep the bag protected from dirt and water.\n\nOn the leather thong at the front of the bag is a stamp with a Swiss Cross and the letter M (Photo 9). There is no date stamp but the number 57 is hand written on the top of the bag (Photo 8).  We think it likely that this refers to the year 1957, because we have sold several of these bags before, all of which come from this time period. \n\nThe size of this Swiss Army bag is perfect to hold your iPad (Photo 2), and has plenty of room for a other smaller items.\n\nThis Swiss Military ammo bag is very, very sturdy.
